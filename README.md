CellChat is a tool that can be used in R to infer, visualize, and analyze cell-to-cell communication using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. The CellChat package was created in the lab of Dr. Qing Nie at the University of California, Irvine. The paper describing CellChat was published in 2021 in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21246-9). To accurately identify roles for specific signaling molecules and pathways in scRNA-Seq datasets, the authors manually curated a literature-supported signaling molecule interaction database called CellChatDB. The database consists of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches.
